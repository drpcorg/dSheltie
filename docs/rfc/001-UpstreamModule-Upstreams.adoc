*Name:* Upstream creation

*Type:* feature

*Author:* https://github.com/KirillPamPam

== Summary

An upstream is the core component of nodecore. It encapsulates the logic of how to work with blockchain nodes or RPC providers. It has its own state and can work via different protocols, such as *JSON-RPC*, *REST*, *Websocket*, *GRPC*.

== Detailed design

=== Reading config file

First of all it's necessary to read the config file and create upstreams from that.

The config example:

[source,yaml]
----
upstream-config:
    chain-defaults:
      - network: ethereum
        poll-interval: 3m
    upstreams:
      - id: eth-upstream
        chain: ethereum
        connectors:
          - type: json-rpc
            url:
            headers:
              Key: Value
          - type: rest
            url:
            headers:
              Key: Value
          - type: websocket
            url:
        methods:
          enable:
            - "eth_test"
            - "arb_trace" # enable the whole method group
          disable:
            - "eth_getId"

=== Upstreams

image::upstream.png[alt="",width=60%,align="center"]

- Each project contains at least one upstream. In order to be able to work with different nodes and RPC providers it contains an array of API connectors. These connectors can work with JSON-RPC API, REST API, Websockets and GRPC API.
- To be able to work with different blockchains an upstream has an abstraction `ChainSpecific`, which encapsulates the logic on how to work with various blockchain types.
- To work with blockchains heads an upstream has an abstraction `HeadProcessor`, which encapsulates the logic on how to work with different heads.
- An upstream has its own state, such as `status`, `head height`, `supported methods`, `finalized block`, `lower bounds`.
- there are 2 statuses - `Available` and `Unavailable`

=== Connector

image::connectors.png[alt="",width=90%,align="center"]

- A `Connector` is an abstraction on how to send requests,  receive and parse responses using different APIs
- It has 2 main methods - `sendRequest` and `subscribe`. Using almost any type of API we can send a request and receive a response at once or subscribe to events.
- In the picture above there are 2 main types of API connectors - `HttpApiConnector` and `WsConnector`. With `HttpApiConnector` we can work with JSON-RPC and REST requests, with `WsConnector` it's possible to work with JSON-RPC only.

=== ChainSpecific

image::chainSpecific.png[alt="",width=90%,align="center"]

- A `ChainSpecific` is an abstraction on how to interact with different types of blockchains and receive their data.
- The main data that needs to be received is `heads`. It's also necessary to parse them differently due to they have their own format, even for ws and rpc heads.
- In the picture above there are 2 ChainSpecific implementation, however there will be much more in order to work with many types of chains.

=== HeadProcessor

image::heads.png[alt="",width=90%,align="center"]

- A `HeadProcessor` in an abstraction to work with different types of heads. It controls to update its height and pass this event further, it observes that there are head updates, otherwise it can trigger a head restart.
- In the picture above there are 2 types of heads - `RpcHead` and `SubscriptionHead`.
- Each head has a connector through which it works
- `RpcHead` polls heads with a `pollInterval` time
- `SubscriptionHead` subscribes to heads events if it's possible. If there are no head updates it can restart its subscription
- By default `RpcHead` is used to receive heads to reduce costs unless a client specify `SubscriptionHead` to work with heads

=== Upstream requests and responses

image::req_resp.png[alt="",width=90%,align="center"]

- in the picture above there are an `UpstreamRequest` and `UpstreamResponse` which are the internal representation of the upstream request and response.

== Unresolved questions

- Do we need to have a list of supported methods as we have in dshackle? Or do we consider that all methods are supported by default unless a client specifies them explicitly?
- Is it necessary to track lower bounds? At least block and state data, so that nodecore can use it to route requests better instead of retries?
- What is the best pollInterval time? Does chain matter, or we could have the same time for all chains?
